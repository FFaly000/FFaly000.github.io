    <title>Congrats you found the first clue. Find the second one. One-syllable words are the best. They’re quick, clear, and strong. You don’t need more to say what you mean. With one sound, you can speak loud and bold. They fit so well in a line or song. They’re short, yet full of might. You can shout or hum them, and they still hit hard.

These words make talk fast and fun. Each one packs a punch, no need for fluff. One-syllable words? They rule, no doubt.</title>
